# algorithms

A few implementations of some common algorithms. I was inspired by [TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) but figured I'd learn more if I tried to implement each algorithm from scratch myself.  

These aren't optimized or anything, 
usually just a simple implementation using wikipedia or some other publicly available source as base.
